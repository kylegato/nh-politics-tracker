- [ ] Create reusable UI components
- [ ] Develop API client for backend communication

### Key Pages
- [ ] Implement home page with state selection
- [ ] Create state detail page with sessions
- [ ] Build bill listing page with filtering
- [ ] Develop bill detail page with history
- [ ] Create search interface with advanced filters

### UI/UX Refinement
- [ ] Design and implement responsive layouts
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Implement pagination controls
- [ ] Optimize for accessibility
- [ ] Add data visualizations where appropriate

## Phase 5: Integration & Deployment (Weeks 11-12)

### Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API
- [ ] Test end-to-end user flows

- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring for production

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Document deployment procedures
- [ ] Prepare maintenance runbook

## Post-Launch (Ongoing)

### Maintenance
- [ ] Regular data quality checks
- [ ] Monitor API usage and performance
- [ ] Apply security patches and updates
- [ ] Optimize based on real-world usage patterns

### Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for additional states
- [ ] Implement user accounts for personalized tracking
- [ ] Develop email notification system for bill updates
- [ ] Create data export functionality
- [ ] Build administrative dashboard for system monitoring

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1 Full-stack developer (primary)
- 1 Frontend developer (part-time for Phase 4)
- 1 DevOps/SRE (part-time for deployment and monitoring)

### Infrastructure
- Cloudflare Workers account
- Cloudflare KV Namespaces
- OpenStates API key with appropriate rate limits
- GitHub repository for code management
- CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions recommended)

### External Dependencies
- OpenStates API stability and availability
- Cloudflare platform reliability
- Availability of legislative data for target states

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **OpenStates API Changes**: Monitor API updates and maintain compatibility
2. **KV Storage Limits**: Plan for data growth and implement cleanup strategies
3. **Performance at Scale**: Conduct regular performance testing as data grows

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Maintain focus on core functionality in initial phases
2. **Timeline Delays**: Build in buffer time for unexpected challenges
3. **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize features based on available resources

## Success Metrics

- **System Uptime**: Target of 99.9% availability
- **Data Freshness**: Updates within 6 hours of legislative changes
- **API Performance**: Average response time under 200ms
- **User Engagement**: Track user session duration and retention
- **Search Effectiveness**: Measure search success rate and refinements
